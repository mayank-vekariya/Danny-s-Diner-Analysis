# Danny's Diner Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the customer and sales data for Danny's Diner to provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, the analysis answers key business questions and visualizes data to support decision-making.

## Project Details
The project is divided into three parts:
1. **SQL Analysis**: Used SQL queries to extract and analyze data from the sales, menu, and members tables. Answered key business questions such as total amount spent by customers, days visited, and the most popular items.
2. **Python Analysis**: Performed data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis using Python. Created summary reports and visualizations to understand customer trends and product performance.
3. **Power BI Report**: Developed a dashboard to visualize insights on customer spending, product popularity, and sales trends. The interactive report helps in identifying key metrics at a glance.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Python**: For data manipulation and generating visual reports.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and data visualization.

## How to Use
1. **SQL Analysis**: Run the SQL queries provided in the `Danny's Diner SQL Challenge.sql` file on the `dannys_diner` database to get detailed insights.
2. **Python Analysis**: Execute the Jupyter Notebook (`Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner.ipynb`) for step-by-step data analysis and visualizations.
3. **Power BI Report**: Open the `Danny's Dinner Power BI Report.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop to view and interact with the dashboard.

## Business Questions Answered
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu, and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

## Results
- Customer A spent the most at the diner, with a total of $76.
- Ramen was the most popular item, with the highest number of purchases.
- Interactive Power BI dashboard helps in understanding customer preferences and sales trends visually.
